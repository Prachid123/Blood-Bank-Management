It saves innumerable lives across the world in a variety of conditions. The need for blood is great - on any given day, approximately 39,000 units of Red Blood Cells are needed. More than 29 million units of blood components are transfused every year.
        Donate Blood 	
        Despite the increase in the number of donors, blood remains in short supply during emergencies, mainly attributed to the lack of information and accessibility.
        
        We positively believe this tool can overcome most of these challenges by effectively connecting the blood donors with the blood recipients.</p>

            Tand the amount of toxic chemicals (e.g. mercury, pesticides, fire retardants) circulating in the blood stream is reduced by the amount contained in given blood.

Common blood types are needed because there are many patients with them. Less common blood types are needed because there are fewer donors to give them. However, people with O- blood are particularly in demand because they are the "universal donor." It means that people of all blood types can receive O- blood safely, so it is used during life-threatening emergencies or when the matching blood type is in short supply. AB types are universal recipients. This relationship is reversed for plasma products. AB type plasma can be transfused to all patients, while O- types are the universal plasma recipients. Therefore, all types are really needed!</div></p>
